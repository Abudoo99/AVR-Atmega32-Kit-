# Real Time Clock using LCD and I2C (Hardware Implementation)

The objective of this project is to display the time on LCD by retrieving real time data from the RTC module. The data is retrieved using I2C communication protocol. In this project, the I2C data is retrieved using I2C registers present in the devkit.
