# Super Mario Game using LCD and Interrupt Button

This is a game design on the development kit. The functionality of the game is as follows :
1. Press input button to start, stop and reset game.
2. Once the game has been started, the mario character will move along the display. Using the interrupt button, navigate your way through the custom defined obstacles present on the way.
3. Score is calculated based on number of obstacles crossed. As time increases, the speed of the game also increases which means there will be more obstacles and less time to navigate (it basically gets more challenging). Until the devkit is plugged out, the scores of previous games are stored in the memory.
